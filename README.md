# How to play?
1. Download your chosen release from the right pane of this page!(I recommend you pick the latest version, will have a .zip extension that is not source code)
2. Unzip the release zip file.
3. Enter the release directory.
4. Run the executable file depending on your operating system:

## Windows
Double click the file `bootstrap-windows.bat` inside of the unzipped release folder in order to run it. This will open multiple log windows for debugging as well.

## Linux
```bash
# Enter the build directory
sh bootstrap-linux.sh
```

5. Enjoy the work in progress!
